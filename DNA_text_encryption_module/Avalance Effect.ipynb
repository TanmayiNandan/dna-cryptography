    "* This notebook collects avalance effect data for Source C\n",
    "* Collection for Source E was not possible because it was discovered that the length of the ciphertext changes even when changing only 1 bit of the key. As a result, calculating a percentage change in ciphertexts by conducting a bit-by-bit comparision of the original ciphertext (e.g., of length `m`) and the new ciphertext (e.g., of length `m + 2`) is not possible."
