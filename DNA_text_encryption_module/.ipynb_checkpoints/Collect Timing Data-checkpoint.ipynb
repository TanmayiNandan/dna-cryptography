      "decrypted ciphertext : ['For thousands of years, humans have tried to enhance their inherent computational abilities using manufactured devices. Mechanical devices such as the abacus, the adding machine, and the tabulating machine were important advances. But it was only with the advent of electronic devices and, in particular, the electronic computer some 60 years ago that a qualitative threshold seems to have been passed and problems of considerable difficulty could be solved. It appears that a molecular device has now been used to pass this qualitative threshold for a second time. ']\n"
